NLP Bigram Project
This project focuses on analyzing and generating bigrams, or two-word sequences, from a given text corpus using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Bigrams are useful for identifying common word pairings, understanding context, and enhancing tasks like text prediction.

Introduction
This project explores the process of extracting bigrams from text data. It includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., removing punctuation, stopwords, lowercasing).
Tokenizing words and creating bigram pairs.
Frequency analysis to find the most common bigrams.
(Optional) Visualizations of bigram frequencies.
The code is implemented in Python, with libraries like nltk, re, and collections for natural language processing and frequency counting.
